# Framework to evaluate talk proposals

The most important resource for evaluating proposals is one past reviewer's guide on how he goes
about a review: https://doughellmann.com/posts/how-i-review-a-pycon-talk-proposal/

Keep in mind that this is just one person's guide and doesn't account for constraints like keeping
a proposal short, so the advice here has to be balanced against examples of successful past
proposals.

# Successful past proposals

Here is a sample of successful past proposals that could be useful to understand the length, level
of detail, and range of writing styles / organization styles typical of accepted talk proposals:
