# Pyre notes and tools

This is a dumping ground for my (Steven Troxler's) personal
Pyre-related bits of code and such. For instance:
- development tools that are either specific to my personal
  preferences or are experiments and I'm not ready to commit
  to the main repo (which is an implicit suggestion that
  other people should use them)
- scratch projects demonstrating typing issues that I felt
  at the time were worth preserving but didn't make sense to
  add to Pyre's test cases
