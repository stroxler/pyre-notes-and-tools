# VSCode setup

## Plugins

- The standard vim-bindings plugin (not neovim-in-vscode - that sounds great
  but seems to be buggy in reality).
- Some color themes
  - Noctis: my preferred color theme pack for VSCode, very nice. I particularly
    like Noctic Azurus (blue), Noctis (green), and Noctis Minimus (gray).
  - Tomorrow Night Blue: a solid theme, and distinct from what I would choose
    for emacs, vim, or terminal. I currently use Noctis for internal VSCode
    and remote machines, Tomorrow Night Blue for stock vscode locally.
- OCaml Platform - the official ocaml toolchain. Mostly works pretty well,
  although I had to write a daemon script to kill duplicate LSP processes
  that periodically start up.
